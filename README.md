# Project: Summary Component (Frontend Mentor Challenge)
This is my solution to the Frontend Mentor challenge for creating a Summary Component. The component showcases a simple, responsive summary layout, including key statistics and icons, built with React and CSS.

# Features:
- A clean, user-friendly summary component displaying key categories and their corresponding scores.
- The design adapts to different screen sizes with responsive styling.
- Utilizes React for dynamic rendering and CSS for styling, ensuring a polished user interface.
# Technologies Used:
React: For building the UI components and handling dynamic data.
CSS: For styling the component and ensuring responsiveness across devices.

# Installation Steps:
-To get the project up and running on your local machine:

Clone the repository or create a new Vite project with the following commands:
npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
After running these commands, the app should be available on http://localhost:3000 by default.
Result:
The app provides a functional and visually appealing summary component where users can view key statistics in a clear, easy-to-read layout.
